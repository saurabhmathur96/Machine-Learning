# Machine-Learning
Some Machine Learning algorithms that I implemented in python

- K-Means : Randomly generates points and clusters them.
- Linear-Regession : Fits a line through 2D points.
- Naive-Bayes : SMS Spam detection.
- color-scheme-from-image : Builds a Self Organizing Map on image and derive color scheme.
- decision-tree : ID3 decision tree to predict car acceptability with xml serialization for model.
- mining-association-rules : Apriori algorithm to find association rules in retail data.
 
Some other implementations, in Java 8

- Decision Tree Classifier (ID3) : Determines car acceptability from some properties of the car like price and technical characteristics. ![Find the repository here.](https://github.com/saurabhmathur96/decisiontree)
- Logistic Regression : Learns the xor (x^y) function ![Find the repository here.](https://github.com/saurabhmathur96/Logistic-Regression)
