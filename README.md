# Machine-Learning
Some Machine Learning algorithms that I implemented in python

- K-Means : randomly generate points and cluster them.
- Linear-Regession : fit a line through 2D points
- Naive-Bayes : SMS Spam detection
- color-scheme-from-image : Builds a Self Organizing Map on image and derive color scheme
- decision-tree : ID3 decision tree to predict car acceptability with xml serialization for model
- mining-association-rules : Apriori algorithm to find association rules in retail data
